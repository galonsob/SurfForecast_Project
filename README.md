## **SurfForecast_Project**

#**Personal project**

Goal: scraping data off one of the main surf forecast websites for a personally well known spot. Store the data in a database and automate the pipeline in order to get history records.
Perform analyses such as identifying the month with the most swell and the month with the most days of offshore winds in order to identify patterns in the conditions.

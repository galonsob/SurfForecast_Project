# SurfForecast_Project
Personal project.
Goal: scraping data off one of the main surf forecast websites for a personally well known spot. Store the data in a database in order to get history records. Perform analysis such as month with the 
most swell, month with most days of offshore winds...in order to determine which month works best for that surf spot.
